To integrate powCAPTCHA into your website, you will also need access to your site's source code, either through a code editor or a content management system (CMS) that allows you to edit HTML and JavaScript.


# Getting Started

To get started with powCAPTCHA, you need to [create an application in your powCAPTCHA dashboard](https://app.powcaptcha.com/apps). Once created, you will receive an APP ID and a Private Key, which you will need to integrate powCAPTCHA into your website.

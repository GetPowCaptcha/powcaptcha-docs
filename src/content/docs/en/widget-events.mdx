    console.log('Challenge solved:', event.detail.token);
});
document.addEventListener('@powcaptcha/widget/error', (event) => {
    console.error('Error occurred:', event.detail.error);
});
document.addEventListener('@powcaptcha/widget/solving', () => {
    console.log('Solving challenge...');
});
document.addEventListener('@powcaptcha/widget/solving/progress', (event) => {
    console.log('Solving progress:', event.detail.progress);
});
```

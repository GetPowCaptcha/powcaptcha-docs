## Loading the powCAPTCHA widget

The easiest way to load the powCAPTCHA widget is to include the following script on your website:

```html
<script src="https://js.powcaptcha.com/widget.js" async defer></script>
```
This script will load the powCAPTCHA widget and make it available for use on your website. Make sure to include it in the `<head>` section of your HTML or just before the closing `</body>` tag.

## Insert the widget in your HTML

To insert the powCAPTCHA widget in your HTML, you need to use the `<powcaptcha-widget>` element. This element will display the widget on your page. Here is a basic example:

```html
<powcaptcha-widget data-app-id="YOUR_APP_ID"></powcaptcha-widget>
```

Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with your actual application ID, which you can find in your powCAPTCHA dashboard.
## Customize the widget
You can customize the widget by adding various attributes to the `<powcaptcha-widget>` element. Refer to the [Widget Attributes](/en/widget-attributes/) section for a complete list of available attributes.

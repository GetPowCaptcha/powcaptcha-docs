Users who have purchased a Pro subscription or higher can use the powCAPTCHA spam filter. The spam filter uses advanced machine learning techniques to detect and filter spam in web forms.

## How to use the spam filter
To use the spam filter, simply include the `spamFilter` parameter in the verification request when verifying the challenge solution.

The `spamFilter` parameter should be an object containing the following fields:
```javascript
{
  email: 'optional_email_to_check_for_spam',
  text: 'optional_text_to_check_for_spam'
}
```
These fields are the ones your users will enter in the form, and the spam filter will analyze them to determine if they are spam or not.
Example:



```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.powcaptcha.com/challenges/verify', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    secret: 'your_private_key',
    solution: 'your_solution_token',
    spamFilter: {
	    email: requestUser.email,
	    text: requestUser.text,
    },
    }),
});

```

When you send the request, the spam filter will analyze the `email` and `text` fields and return a response like the following:
```json
{
  "type": "item",
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "signals": {
      "score": 0.78
    },
    "spamFilter": {
      "took": 100,
      "score": 0.4,
      "text": {
        "score": 0.25,
        "languages": [],
        "reasons": [
          "text.GIBBERISH_NONSENSICAL"
        ]
      },
      "email": {
        "score": 0.55,
        "reasons": [
          "email.FREE_PROVIDER"
        ]
      }
    },
    "success": true,
    "visitor": {
      "id": "VISITOR_ID",
      "continent": "USER_CONTINENT",
      "country": "USER_COUNTRY",
      "region": "USER_REGION",
      "city": "USER_CITY",
      "postalCode": "USER_POSTAL_CODE",
      "timezone": "USER_TIMEZONE",
      "isEUCountry": "USER_IS_EU_COUNTRY",
      "latitude": "USER_LATITUDE",
      "longitude": "USER_LONGITUDE"
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see, the `spamFilter` field contains an object with the spam score and the reasons why it is considered spam. The score ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means it is highly likely to be spam and 1 means it is not spam.

The `spamFilter.score` field will contain the overall spam filter score (which is the average of both), while the `spamFilter.text` and `spamFilter.email` fields will contain the specific score and reasons for the text and email, respectively.
Based on the score, you can decide whether to accept or reject the form. For example, if the score is less than 0.5, you can consider it spam and reject the form by showing an error message to the user.
```javascript 
if (response.data.spamFilter.score < 0.5) {
  // Mostrar mensaje de error al usuario
  console.error('El formulario ha sido marcado como spam');
} else {
  // Procesar el formulario
  console.log('El formulario ha sido aceptado');
}
```
